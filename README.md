## Example simulations

`example_simulations/`

This directory contains Python scripts for OpenMM simulations of test 2-D and 3-D systems,
demonstrating various capabilities of OpenMM.

Systems modelled:
- Protein in water
- Box of water
- Box of gaseous Lennard-Jones particles
- 2-D Lennard-Jones particles

## Unbiased simulations:

`unbiased_simulations`

Contains Python scripts for OpenMM simulations of:
- 2-D particles on a Muller-Brown potential energy surface
- Butane in water
- Alanine dipeptide in water

## Umbrella sampling demo

`umbrella_sampling_demo`

This directory contains umbrella sampling code for a system of particles on a 2-D Muller-Brown potential energy surface.
